# Quanta Qualia AI

"*Quanta Qualia AI*" is a project pioneering a frontier of quantum computing and communication exploring entangled particles such as "traditional" electrons, ions, photons or even neutrinos. 

## Understanding Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computing 

The field of Quantum mechanics and computing are very poorly understood even in the general science community. Below, I am attempting to provide a set of short questions and answers that hopefully will provide enough background for the conversation.

#### Q: How is it possible for particles to instantly interact over vast distances?

We humans have an "**illusion**" of **time** **dimension** and the illusion of **space**. Let me throw the **gravity** to the mix, too.

In reality, there is a multi-dimensional matrix of **vibrations** that underpin what we perceive as space-time or the matter (in another words, the things). 
The time is perceived only in context of events that we "perceive".

This **matrix** can be **stable**, or it can **bend**, creating **gravity holes**, in extreme, but common cases, it can loop on itself. 

Objects can be **entangled** by sharing properties of this matrix and in some cases the distance and time can be **non-consequential**, in which case see perceive the two particles as behaving the same even when separated by light-years of travel.

#### Q: What role does measurement play in entanglement?

A: Measurement plays a crucial role in entanglement. When you measure one particle of an entangled pair (or set), the outcome determines the state of the other particle instantaneously. However, until the measurement is made, the particles exist in a superposition of states, and the outcome is fundamentally probabilistic.

#### Q: How do we ensure validity of the probabilistic set of entangled particles?

If we were to consider only a pair of entangled particles, the probability of a message would be low. The stability of the quantum particles is low.  
By using a large set of entangled particles we decrease the error and increase the certainty of the message. 

#### Q: How are different types of neutrinos distinguished?

A: Neutrinos are distinguished by their flavor: **electron neutrinos, muon neutrinos, and tau neutrinos**. These flavors are associated with the corresponding charged leptons (electron, muon, tau). Neutrino flavor is identified through the detection of the specific charged lepton produced in a neutrino interaction.
