This minimal PyTorch example implements a custom recurrent neural network (RNN) cell from first principles, showing how sequence memory emerges through feedback.
The cell maintains a hidden state vector h, which evolves over time using the current input x and the previous hidden state through the nonlinear update h = tanh(Wₕₕh + Wₓₕx). The output y = Wₕy h is then computed as a simple linear projection of the hidden state.

Unlike PyTorch’s built-in nn.RNN, this implementation makes every matrix and operation explicit, clearly illustrating how temporal dependencies are learned through recursive state updates rather than static input-output mappings.

import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# pick device (use "mps" on Apple Silicon;
# macOS Metal hardware acceleration
device = torch.device("mps" if torch.backends.mps.is_available() else "cpu")

class MyRNNCell(nn.Module):

# rnn_units: number of hidden neurons
def __init__(self, rnn_units, input_dim, output_dim):

super().__init__()

# weight matrices, * 0.01 scales the random weight initialization to small values

self.W_xh = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(rnn_units, input_dim) * 0.01)

self.W_hh = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(rnn_units, rnn_units) * 0.01)

self.W_hy = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(output_dim, rnn_units) * 0.01)

# hidden state h initialized to zeros

self.register_buffer("h", torch.zeros(rnn_units, 1))

def forward(self, x):

# x is shape [input_dim, 1]

self.h = torch.tanh(self.W_hh @ self.h + self.W_xh @ x)

y = self.W_hy @ self.h

return y, self.h

# minimal usage example

if __name__ == "__main__":

rnn = MyRNNCell(rnn_units=16, input_dim=8, output_dim=4).to(device)

x_t = torch.randn(8, 1, device=device) # input vector at time t

y_t, h_t = rnn(x_t)

print(y_t.shape, h_t.shape) # torch.Size([4, 1]) torch.Size([16, 1])

A practical use of this minimal RNN cell is to predict or generate sequential data, where each step depends on the previous one.

For example:

-

Time series forecasting: Feed in one value at a time (like daily temperatures or stock prices) and train it to predict the next value.

-

Character-level text generation: Convert characters to one-hot vectors, feed them sequentially, and let the RNN learn to predict the next character.

-

Signal smoothing or sensor prediction: Use it to process sequential readings (like a boat’s wind and wave sensors) to predict future conditions.

Even though it’s a tiny model, it demonstrates the whole idea: maintaining internal memory (h) to connect past inputs with future outputs.

Various RNN configurations:

- single input > RNN cell > single result for binary classification

- many inputs > many RNN cells > single output: sentiment classification

- single input > many RNN cells > many outputs: text generation, image captions

- many inputs > many RNN cells > many outputs: translation, music generation

Think of an RNN as a storyteller that remembers what has already been said while deciding what comes next. Each RNN cell is like one frame in a film reel—receiving new input, updating its memory, and passing that memory forward. When you connect many cells in series, the network forms a chain of thought through time: it doesn’t see the whole story at once but recalls what just happened. In a simple one-to-one setup, it’s like hearing a single word and deciding “yes” or “no.” With many inputs feeding into a single output, it listens to a whole sentence before forming an opinion, such as judging sentiment. With one input producing many outputs, it’s as if the RNN takes one idea and tells a whole story, step by step. And when many inputs produce many outputs, it becomes a fluent translator or composer—listening, remembering, and responding continuously.
