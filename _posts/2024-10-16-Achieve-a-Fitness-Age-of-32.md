According to Garmin, My "Fitness Age," is 44 years.

My guru (ChatGPT) says:
# Goal: Achieve a Fitness Age of 32

## VO2 Max Target:

Aim for **50-52** mL/kg/min through consistent endurance training (HIIT, long runs, cycling, or swimming).

## Maintain Resting Heart Rate:

Keep your resting heart rate around **45 bpm** with a mix of cardio and recovery practices.

## Exercise Routine:

- 5-6 days per week with:
- 2-3 cardio sessions: Mix high-intensity intervals and steady-state cardio.
- 2 strength sessions: Focus on functional strength (e.g., squats, pull-ups).
- 1-2 recovery sessions: Yoga, stretching, or low-intensity work.

## Body Composition:

Maintain **body fat** at 14.2% or slightly lower, aiming for **12-14%**.

## Nutrition & Recovery:

Stick to your **Paleo/pastoral diet**, prioritize **sleep**, and manage **stress** for optimal **recovery**.
Stay consistent, monitor progress with your Garmin, and you'll be on track to reach that fitness age of 32!
