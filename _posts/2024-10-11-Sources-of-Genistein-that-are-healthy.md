Short answer: Miso soup (fermented soy beans)

Long Answer:

Genistein is a naturally occurring isoflavone, a type of phytoestrogen, most commonly found in soy products. It has been studied for its potential health benefits, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, as well as potential protective effects against certain types of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. If you're looking for healthy sources of genistein, here are some of the best options:

### 1. **Fermented Soy Products**

Fermentation increases the bioavailability of genistein and other beneficial compounds, while reducing potentially harmful antinutrients found in soy.

- **Tempeh**: A fermented soy product rich in genistein, protein, and probiotics. The fermentation process enhances nutrient absorption, making it a highly nutritious choice.
- **Miso**: A fermented soybean paste often used in soups and marinades. It’s another excellent source of genistein with the added benefit of gut-friendly bacteria.
- **Natto**: A traditional Japanese food made from fermented soybeans. Though it has a strong flavor and sticky texture, natto is packed with genistein and vitamin K2, promoting heart and bone health.

### 2. **Non-Fermented Soy Products**

These are good sources of genistein, though some people prefer fermented varieties to enhance digestibility and nutrient absorption.

- **Tofu**: Made from coagulated soy milk, tofu is an easy-to-use and versatile ingredient. It’s a rich source of genistein and contains essential amino acids.
- **Edamame**: Young, green soybeans that are minimally processed. Steamed edamame is a whole food source of genistein and provides fiber, protein, and healthy fats.
- **Soy Milk**: Fortified soy milk offers a plant-based alternative to dairy milk and contains genistein, protein, and calcium (if fortified).

### 3. **Lentils and Chickpeas**

Though soy is the most concentrated source of genistein, other legumes like lentils and chickpeas contain small amounts of isoflavones, including genistein. Incorporating these legumes into your diet can still contribute to your genistein intake while providing plant-based protein, fiber, and essential nutrients.

### 4. **Alfalfa Sprouts**

Alfalfa sprouts are a surprising source of genistein and other phytoestrogens. While the content is not as high as in soy products, these sprouts are a light, healthy addition to salads and sandwiches.

### 5. **Fava Beans**

Fava beans contain small amounts of genistein and are packed with other essential nutrients like protein, fiber, and iron. They can be enjoyed cooked in a variety of dishes, from soups to stews.

### 6. **Pistachios**

Though nuts are not generally known for high isoflavone content, pistachios do contain a small amount of genistein. Additionally, they are a healthy source of protein, fiber, and healthy fats, making them a good option for a well-rounded diet.

### Health Considerations

When choosing soy products as a source of genistein, it’s best to opt for organic, non-GMO varieties whenever possible. Fermented soy products tend to be healthier choices because they improve nutrient absorption and reduce potential digestive issues associated with soy.

### Conclusion

Healthy sources of genistein include a variety of soy-based and legume products, with fermented soy options like tempeh, miso, and natto being particularly beneficial. Including a mix of these in your diet can help you enjoy the potential health benefits of genistein while supporting overall nutrition.
