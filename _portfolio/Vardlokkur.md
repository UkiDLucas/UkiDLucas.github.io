Advancement does not come equally fast in all regions. Some places are remate, wild and unhabitted and their culture may lag by hundreds, ar even thousands years. In around the fifth century & B.C. the northern edge of Carpathian mountains was such place, where people lived the same way as they always have for thousands of years.

This region was the southern most reach of glaciers, which when retreated, left a baren gravel hills in its wake. Eventually, the region got overgrown by dense forests.

## **Toba: 70 thousand years ago** {#toba:-70-thousand-years-ago}

First Draft: 2008-03-30

This is a story about the last days of the great human culture .  

 

I am writing this story from the perspective of 71 thousand years later. The story is based on the findings in anthropology, geology, genetics of human migrations, bone and other artifacts. 


The described culture had its roots in the events much earlier when 125 thousands years ago the temperatures were about 4 degrees warmer than today, and the droughts in central Africa pushed humans in search of the new lands. 

In the following 20 thousands years humans colonized much of the Eurasia. They became successful despite the fact that they were competing with other hominids and great mammals.  


Eventually they developed a great oral culture with poetry, history and medicine, they mostly spoke the similar languages and they had deep understanding of their environment. They colonized Europe all the way from Ural Mountains to Scandinavia and British Isles.     

When 105 thousand years ago the climate started to cool down to about 3 degrees less than today, and the glaciers returned to the Northern Europe, the human population was already established and thriving.  


At the time of the story, 71 thousand years ago, there were well over 150 thousand humans spread across Africa, Europe and Southern Asia.    

 

This is when the disaster came and wiped out humanity.     

 

The explosion of Indonesian volcano Toba was not unusual in the history of the Earth; in fact gigantic caldera explosions happens at least every 100 thousand years (1).


Yet, the 750 cubic miles of ash thrown into the atmosphere by Toba was a thousand times stronger than any other volcanic explosion in the modern times, including the 1982 eruption of Mt. St. Helen. In comparison tiny explosion of Philippine's  Krakatoa in 536 AD darkened  the sun for eighteen months, and the explosion of Mount Tambor in 1816 caused the "Year without a summer" resulting the widespread famine and related diseases which wiped out 200,000 people, or one-third of Europe.


The explosion of Toba in Sumatra was absolutely devastating, the ashes suspended in the stratosphere caused a six-year volcanic winter with the crop failures, and caused the already cold temperatures to plummet another several degrees. The whole world fell in one of the deepest ice ages. About 90 percent of the humanity starved to death, the remaining 15,000 or so, were too small of the gene pool to rebound and for all practical purposes  disappeared for the next 60 thousand years.  

ad1) The Yellowstone caldera is 30 x 50 miles wide and it is considered to be active, its pending explosion will have similar effects on humanity as the described explosion of Toba. Or, rather, it will be magnified by the magnitude of density of the modern human population.

## **The Shelter**  {#the-shelter}

First draft: 2008-03-18 

 The afternoon sun was already low, sparkling golden and yellow rays among the tops of ancient firs and spurce trees. It was time to set up the shelter, the night would be chilly at this elevation in middle of the spring. Finding a suitable location did not pose any problem, previous year's storms fell so many trees that natural shelters were abound. Vardlokkur stepped off the deer path he was following into the dense forest in the direction of the wind, he walked carefully so not to leave any signs behind, it was a habit that might have saved him from trouble many times. After a couple hundred of paces he found a perfect spot; an overturned fir with a wall of roots pointing several feet into the air. At the base of the roots was yellowish clay and a pool of clear water, the water was clean enough to wash, but not to drink. He would inspect the clay-plastered roots in the morning for flints. 

 

He went around the tree and found exactly what he wanted. The fallen tree trunk created a roof at least five feet wide and about the same high above the ground, what used to be the dry needle-covered base of the tree now created a cozy wall. That wall would protect him from the wind and the eyes of anybody traveling on the path, he could start a small fire knowing that the flame was well hidden by the wall and the smoke would carry with the wind away from the path. 

 

While doing a habitual sweep of the area nearby, he gathered some branches and smaller firewood sticks. The long branches would provide additional wall support when pushed into the soil and leaned against trunk above, tying where needed with the thin and flexible spruce roots which run in all directions on the ground. He chopped a few low hanging branches of a twenty year old fir to create an outer covering of the shelter, he hung the branches with the needles pointing down intertwining the branches to strengthen his construction. He liked to work with fir, the flat branches provided the best protection from the elements, they were natural shingles of the forest, also the needles were not sharp as these of spruce. He moved quickly with efficiency that came only with hundreds of times he did the same thing since his childhood. The sun was almost setting when he finished his shelter preparation, he had nothing else to do, but to make fire and relax. Quickly, he pushed the dry needles into a comfortable bed about half a foot tall. 

 

Making fire would be as easy, Vardlokkur did not rush. He's cleared the ground for the fire pit from the needles and anything else that could catch on the fire at night, he stacked the bigger branches into a small pyramid, the smaller twigs went inside leaving space for his starter tinder. From his backpack he pulled a waxed, water-tight leather pouch. Almost religiously, he spread the content on top of the pouch, being careful not to place anything on the damp soil. There was a flint, a small, semi-spherical piece of metallic meteor, a small grass bird nest, some dry moss, pieces of black "cramp balls" fungi. He had a habit of picking up these items during his hikes and always having an ample supply. He pulled a some grass and made a little tinder nest on top of his palm, he put it aside. He took a pinch of dry moss and placed it on the slice of fungi. A quick inspection of the flint with the thumb revealed a the best, sharpest edge, he struck it against the flat, metallic side of the meteor, the sparks were hardly visible. After no more than five well placed strikes the  delicate ember started to glow and a tiny vein of the smoke snaked upwards. Carefully he grabbed the moss between two pieces of fungi and blew gently, the smoke intensified, fungi edge became red hot, he dropped the embers into the grass nest and blew more, the grass caught on fire. He placed the grass fire ball inside the wood pyramid and made sure the fungi he used to start the fire with is fully extinguished and stowed away together with all other fire starters. 

 

He did not have to cook tonight, he still had some bread and meat left from last night. He ate slowly enjoying the warmth of the fire, he placed his backpack under his head, the hunting bow and quiver of arrows within the easy reach, he covered himself and while listening to the quiet and familiar forest he drifted away into the peaceful dreams.

## **The Dream and the Hunt**  {#the-dream-and-the-hunt}

First Draft: 2008-03-18 

Vardlokkur awoke long before the dawn with the strong feeling of loss and longing. He has been traveling alone since last spring, visiting people living far to the south. He has spent last summer on the shores of the great lake.


That girl visited him in the dreams again. Her face, full lips, long dark hair, beautiful hips and long legs still danced in his mind. The smooth, longing music of the nomadic tribes of the south played a lonely note in his head, her hips shook rhythmically to the drum beat, her beautiful hands spread to the sides followed the soft tone.  She was not of his people, but then again, there were so many strange people from different nations down south, not like here, up in the northern mountains. Here, lived his people, but he still missed her.  

 

The beautiful shapes of his dreams have fled quickly as if scared of this cold night in this far, far away place. Suddenly, he felt emptiness piercing his soul. There was no point sleeping anymore, he needed to clear his head.  

 

He got out of the shelter and could still see the stars above the tree tops, he recognized familiar constellations, for him they were old friends, compass, calendar and the time piece. It was early, but it was a good time to think about a hunt. Normally, he hunted the rabbits and and prairie hens with snares, he did not need to take any bigger animals, normally he wouldn't, but since he traveled mostly in dense forest for last few weeks, he did not see any rabbits, nor fowl. He got a few squirrels, but they had hardly any meat on them in spring. This time he had to get deer and early morning was the best time for it. He back-tracked to the edge small clearing he spotted the last night and waited with the clear view of the path, downwind. The bow he carried was a war bow, used more for the defense than hunting. A smaller man, or woman could hook the bowstring on the tree branch and hang on it while holding to the bow handle and not being able stretch it to the full draw. He would use the bow on bears, wolves, bob cats in these forests, or the lions and tigers of the south, he did not like to take big animals unnecessarily. Yes, he had to use it against humans, too, but he had no regrets about these he had slain. The fifty paces of clearing was nothing for the bow, he knew that the arrow would pass clearly thru the deer chest on both sides smashing the bones on the way, he could do the same at two hundred paces. He waited, knowing the deer would eventually come to the clearing. 

 

The music of a stringed instrument of a far away came back to his mind, it filled the forest around, the shy light was emerging to the east. 

 

There was a hardly hearable movement across the clearing, a small heard of deer entered carefully. He spotted the smaller doe at the end. Silently, he made a short prayer and let the heavy arrow fly, the bowstring hitting home was almost totally silent due to the bow profile and the feathers intertwined into the bowstring. The arrow that came thru the doe and splashed some bark of the old tree behind. The herd run across the clearing and toward Vardlokkur, never aware of his presence. The doe never knew what hit it, it was dead in few seconds, still on the edge of the clearing, few steps from where it stood. 

## **Vardlokkur's name**  {#vardlokkur's-name}

First Draft: 2008-03-19 

Vardlokkur has not always been called by this name, he went by as Uki Grzeszkov among his own people. 

 

His father's family name was called the warlocks (oath-beakers), or Grzeshkov(1) in the mountain dialect. Vardlokkur did not know the reason for such a bad name, it had been the dark mystery lost in the northern roots of his father's family. His father moved south to live with the mountain people, but his steel-gray eyes betrayed his northern origins. His strong body, and high-strung demeanor demanded respect. Nobody ever asked any questions. 

 

His mother's ancestors has been known for hundreds of years simply as archers, or Ukasik(2) since the bows were called "uki" in the mountain dialect. They were indeed the archers, flintnappers, fletchers and the bowyers as far as the memory goes,  their memories went far. His people had a habit of memorizing the ancestry history and details about them far into the ancient times, but that is another story. 

 

Vardlokkur got his nickname when he once stayed with the people of the north who lived where the great glacier sheets run into the great lakes. These people were warriors and highly valued Vardlokkur's bowyer skills. His name came for the translation of word warlock, which was closely related to their own language varð-lokkur. It was also because Vardlokkur's knowledge of medicinal plants, deep understanding of animals and human habits and the various poisons he could make for his arrow tips. In the eyes of the norther warriors Vardlokkur was a hunter-shaman, the spirit caller. 

 

Once, while with the Northern warriors, Vardlokkur took part in one of the conflicts against the neighboring tribe. His powerful bow shaped like a snake and covered with the rattler's skin combined with his ability to shoot poisoned and accurate arrows every fifth count assured that he called many spirits that day, but again that is a story for another time. 

 

 

Authors footer notes:

"grzesz" \- means to sin 

"kov" \- short for "covent", and ancient word convent, the gathering, the agreement, the oath among a group of people 

The reason for the name was forgotten, but suggest that one of the ancestors broke the rules and was expelled from the community.

## **Military service**  {#military-service}

FIrst Draft: 2008-03-28 

The war bow Vardlokkur was carrying was one of the few material things that reminded him of the military service, already over a decade ago. That bow, and certain traits were only the surface, inside the service left much deeper marks. Vardlokkur, like all young men of his country had to serve for four years. Just as it was the custom, he reported to local garrison on his eighteen birthday. That day he, and few other young men, were interviewed by the old war-worn officer that was visiting all the posts in the mountains. They were asked about tracking, bow hunting 

and living off the mountains, which was a good sign because serving in the neighboring mountains was the best thing that could happen to a highlander like Vardlokkur. Many other young men were fighting the never-ending wars on the great steppes together with the great armies of many people and nationalities. Much to his surprise, the next day he was ordered to join a small unit and march North, but not to the great 

steppes, but farther to the sea, he was to join the great army training grounds. 

 The march was long and strenuous, over 1200 miles, and what he did not know it was the first part of the training. On the way up, they were to hunt for food, make fire and shelter and avoid contact with the 

locals. All of this under the ever-watching eye of the seasoned warriors that lead them, the warriors just watched, did not help. After about 20 days, of which most was spent crossing the mountains in the South they reached the sea side. It was a first time Vardlokkur had seen so much water. This was also the first time he had seen so many soldiers, there were at least thirty thousand of them, training and preparing constantly. 

 Vardlokkur has joined the regular training that consisted of a lot of physical training, long marches and runs, formation fighting, fortification building and fortification machinery maintenance, all of that large scale army stuff. After few weeks of that he became quite accustomed to it and frankly a little dismayed. Army was not what he dreamt of, the large numbers of lowly skilled men, trained to hold their spears in certain way to prevent cavalry to pass, train to hit with their spears in attack, and shooting their bows at angle to blanket the enemy with arrows some 200 paces away. It was boring. 

 About the same time the old war-warn officer returned form the tour of the mountain posts . All suddenly, most of the young highlanders were called in and there were about 150 of them all together from different 

parts of the mountains, yet all belonging to more-or-less same nation. 

 The old warrior stood in front of them. They noticed that he was short, much shorter than any of them, he was also of dark in complexion,  like one of the people from the far South-East, Catalonia some said, far, even beyond the mountain ranges Vardlokkur came from. He spoke in a calm, yet attention riveting voice: 

 "So, boys, how was the vacation so far?" 

 The gentle wave went thru the crowd, it was no vacation at all, they all trained and had hardly any time to sleep. Nobody said anything, the Catalonian was not a person to contradict, without having your head ripped off by one of the old mean looking warriors that stood behind him. 

 "Well, so how are your field archery skills, any good?" 

 "Outstanding, sir" \- the youth answered in unison as taught. 

 "And do you like your new shiny red uniforms?"  \- ask the Catalonian 

 "Yes, sir" they screamed, just then noticing that the old warriors clothing were somewhat drab, indistinguishable. 

 "Well, boys, from today on, I will be your commanding officer and these are your new teachers.." \- he said pointing at the warriors in the back without turning around \- ".. we go way back, .. way back.. now, ladies, do me a favor and FORGET all of what you have learned in this great shiny army, the training starts tomorrow before 

daybreak.

## **Welcome scouts**  {#welcome-scouts}

First Darft: 2008-03-28 

All of the men were asked to move and set up in the area a few miles from the main camp which was to be called the "Court House Bay". The bay  was indeed right on the water and there was an old fort there with the old sun-dry clay brick court, and few other buildings. The buildings were used by the warfare engineers, constantly building, testing and repairing their contraptions used in fortification sieges. Other than the few hundred paces of the clearing the bay area was surrounded by the forrest lying so low to the water that much of it was an impassable mash. Only one road led to the camp.    

 

The next morning before the sun rise, one of the veteran warriors stepped among the sleeping men around dying fire pits. He lightly pushed one of them with the sole of his shoe. When the young guys stirred and some already lifted their heads, the veteran said in the low quiet voice:  

 

"Hash, not a word\! Get up, get your gear, we are going for a walk"  

 

They walked a few miles into a moonlit, quiet forrest, nobody said anything, they followed the warrior who moved silently with premeditation of a lynx going to his favorite hunting ground.  

 

They turned many times somehow avoiding the deep water marsh, they could see that there was no path to where they went, the warrior however always found the way and was able to easily pass thru the dense undergrowth without breaking any branches.  Soon they knew they were somewhere where no human walked in many, many years. They were in a primordial forrest.  

 

After a while of walking they got to a clearing. The eastern side of the sky started to lighten and the stars were not visible anymore. They stopped. After a few moments of silence and waiting they noticed that the warrior is looking at the trees the right, his face relaxed and grinning. From the trees as if a ghostly shadow, a shape slowly moved towards them, at fifteen paces they recognized the Catalonian.  

 

"Good morning, ladies, you were chosen because all of you are hunters and trackers, but from the looks of your surprised faces I gather you had no clue I was waiting here" he stopped. The silence, or even embarrassment on youth's faces was the answer, somehow they knew they were no longer suppose to answer loudly in unison "No, Sir".  

 

Catalonian smiled, gave a quick quiet whistle and waved his hand as if inviting somebody to join the party. Slowly, one-by-one the shapes emerged from all around, the trees, the tall grasses, some raised from mere few feet away. The faces of the young highlanders was a picture of utter bewilderment.  

 

"Welcome scouts," said the Catalonian \- "you will learn to hide and track, too, I promise you... now... sit down and eat your breakfast, I've got much to tell you." he sounded almost like a good father.  

 

As the ghosts converged on the highlanders, highlanders started to recognize the faces of the warriors from yesterday.  

 

One of the ghosts handled a mitt to one of the highlanders, "Here you dropped it on the way", the face of the youth burned with shame as he took the item and stuffed it into a pocket.  

 

"The first rule" said Catalonian "is that you will NOT talk about what you learn here. It is our advantage that people are not aware of what we are capable of.. you open your mouth and somebody dies."  

 

"Unlike our flashy army crowd, we are silent, we go deep into the enemy territory, we find out what they are doing, most of the time unnoticed. That's why they call us scouts." 

 

"Sometimes, " he continued, "when needed, we dispose of certain enemy target, sometimes we retrieve certain items, or people, from enemy camps. We operate at night, during the day we lay low, waiting and watching. Clear so far?"  

 

The low hum acknowledged the Catalonian, the heads held tall showed the new-born pride.  

 

"Here are our weapons" , he said, as he grabbed his 5 foot walking stick and pooled it apart into two pieces. The bright, narrow foot-and-a-half steel blade caught the first rays of the sun, in one movement he sliced thru the finger-thick tree shoot and shielded the blade back into a single stick. The blade was obviously razor sharp. Vardlokkur, as most of other highlanders never had steel blades, they used flints.  

 

Catalonian took his bow and handled it to one of the highlanders, "Here, shoot at that tree over there" The kid took the bow, pulled out one of is own arrows, nocked it into a bow string, lifted the bow, stretching it about 2 inches and seemingly hit the wall, the bow did not move.  

 

"You try," Catalonian said, pointing at young Vardlokkur, the youngster jumped up eager, took the bow with the same arrow and gave it a jerk, the bow did not bulge. All others could see his jaw drop in disbelief. He simply did not have the strength to pull the bow. The Catalonia took the bow and effortlessly shot the arrow at the tree.  

 

"Don't worry, you'll get there too.. take practice.. go fetch your arrow" Catalonian said to the highlander, at the same time he sat down and opened the sack he was carrying, from it he pulled various items, first of them being a jar of what looked like a red jam.   

 

One of the warriors brought a hare, the animal was kicking furiously when lifted by the fold of the back skin and ears, but then quieting when placed on the ground in front of the Catalonian. The eyes of the hare betrayed fear and the willingness to run at the first chance.  

 

The Catalonian pulled one of his own arrows, dipped the tip in the jam, grabed a fold of the hare's skin and made a small puncture wound, barely a few drops of blood came out of the narrow slit, nothing more than the scratch the hare could get from hopping thru the wild rose bushes while running away from a fox. He released the hare and gave it a small slap in the rear. The hare jumped high and took off like crazy, the first couple of jumps were long, but then suddenly he stumbled and fell, by the time its body stopped moving the hare was already dead.  

 

Catalonian got up and spoke, "You will use your bows like hunters, you will use the plants around you to make strong poisons fro your arrows, you will learn to use your stick and still blades as necessary. Now, let's start the training.."  

 

The sun was already high up and shining brightly.

## **The Old Gods** {#the-old-gods}

First Draft: 2024-07-10

Proto-Indo-European (**PIE**) Gods

### 

### **Kzem Mater (PIE) Mother Earth** {#kzem-mater-(pie)-mother-earth}

* Gaia (Greek)  
* Terra (Latin)  
* Mati Syra Zemlya (Slavic) “Mother (Damp/Fertile) Earth”  
* Žemyna (Baltic)  
* Prithvi (Vedic)

**Kzem Mater** (PIE: *k̑m̥tēr* or *dʰéǵʰōm méh₂tēr*) is a reasonable approximation for "Mother Earth" in Proto-Indo-European. It combines the root for "earth" with the root for "mother," reflecting the widespread linguistic heritage of Indo-European languages. This term is derived from the PIE root "\*dʰéǵʰōm," which itself originates from the root "\*dʰéǵʰ-," meaning "to form, build, or knead." This root conveys the idea of shaping or creating something solid and substantial, which is fitting for the concept of earth.

Here are some words in various Indo-European languages that derive from the same PIE root:

1. **Greek**: **Chthōn (χθών)** – meaning "earth" or "ground," seen in the word "chthonic," which refers to deities or spirits of the underworld.  
2. **Latin**: **Humus** – meaning "ground" or "soil," as seen in words like "humble" (literally "close to the ground") and "exhume" (to dig out of the ground).  
3. **Sanskrit**: **Kṣam (क्षम्)** – meaning "earth" or "soil," as seen in "Kṣamā" (earth or ground).  
4. **Old English**: **Guma** – meaning "man" (literally "earth-man," as in "bridegroom"), related to the sense of being formed from the earth.  
5. **Tocharian**: **Käntu** – meaning "earth," found in the Tocharian languages of Central Asia.  
6. **Slavic**: **Zemlja (земля)** – meaning "earth," related to the modern Slavic words for "earth" or "land" (e.g., Russian "zemlya").  
7. **Lithuanian**: **Žemė** – meaning "earth" or "land," reflecting a similar etymological development as in the Slavic languages.  
8. **Avestan (an ancient Iranian language)**: **Zam** – meaning "earth," which is related to the modern Persian "zamīn" (earth or ground).

The PIE root "\*dʰéǵʰōm" and its derivatives across these languages illustrate how the concept of "earth" was fundamental to various Indo-European cultures and languages, often carrying connotations of creation, fertility, and the material world.

### **Dyeus Pater (PIE) Sky Father** {#dyeus-pater-(pie)-sky-father}

* Zeus (Greek),   
* Jupiter (Latin),   
* Dazhbog (Slavic),   
* Dievs (Baltic),   
* Indra (Vedic)

​​The Proto-Indo-European (PIE) phrase "\*Dyeus Pater" translates to "Sky Father" and is composed of two elements: "\*Dyeus" and "\*Pater."

1. **"\*Dyeus"**: This term is derived from the PIE root "\*dyeu-" which means "to shine" or "sky" and often refers to the bright sky or daylight. The root "\*dyeu-" is associated with divinity and celestial phenomena, reflecting the ancient perception of the sky as a divine realm.  
2. **"\*Pater"**: This term is derived from the PIE root "\*ph₂tḗr," which means "father." The root is common across many Indo-European languages and signifies paternal authority, protection, and leadership.

The combination "\*Dyeus Pater" thus signifies a paternal deity associated with the sky or daylight, often regarded as the chief god or father of the gods in various Indo-European mythologies.

Here are some words in various Indo-European languages that derive from the same PIE roots:

1. **Greek**:  
   * **Zeus (Ζεύς)** – The chief god, ruler of the sky, thunder, and lightning.  
   * **Dios (Διός)** – A form of Zeus, often seen in compound names and phrases.  
2. **Latin**:  
   * **Jupiter** – Derived from the combination "Iou" (an older form of the name) and "Pater," meaning "Sky Father" or "Father Jove."  
   * **Dies** – Meaning "day," related to the bright sky.  
3. **Sanskrit**:  
   * **Dyaus Pita (द्यौष्पितृ)** – The sky father, a Vedic deity representing the sky.  
   * **Div (दिव्)** – Meaning "sky" or "heaven."  
4. **Old English**:  
   * **Tiw** – A sky god, related to the Germanic god Tiwaz or Tyr, reflecting an older form of the sky father deity.  
5. **Slavic**:  
   * **Dazhbog (Дажьбог)** – A sun god, often associated with the sky and daylight.  
   * **Div (див)** – Meaning "god" or "heavenly."  
6. **Lithuanian**:  
   * **Dievas** – Meaning "god," reflecting the divine aspect of the sky.  
   * **Dangus** – Meaning "sky" or "heaven."  
7. **Tocharian**:  
   * **Tsaiwäs** – A sky deity, illustrating the linguistic connection to the concept of divinity and the sky.  
8. **Avestan (an ancient Iranian language)**:  
   * **Daeva** – Originally meaning "god," though it later took on a negative connotation in Zoroastrianism.
